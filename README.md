# Kobo-voice-commands
Project to enable me to turn pages  by voice  on my Kobo H2O e-reader  â€“ help needed
I have a disability  and I am paralysed from my neck down.  I'm looking into the possibility  to turn pages by voice on my e-reader.  One approach is to use an Intel Compute stick with voice recognition to send commands over the USB port to the reader.
